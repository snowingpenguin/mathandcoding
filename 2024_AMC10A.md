### Problem 1

Problem 1, is simple arithmitic, all you have to do is multiply the numbers and subtract them. There isn't really anything else to it. 9901x101 = 1000001 and 99x10101 = 999999, if you subract the two,you get 2, which is answer choice A.


### Problem 2

So for Problem 2, it's basically two equations with two variables, L and G, then they ask you to solve for,
4.2L + 4000G. They first tell you that 1.5L + 800G = 69 and 1.2L + 1200G = 69, which means that they are equal to each other,
so 1.5L + 800G = 1.2L = 1200G, then, you can simplify to get 0.3L = 300G, At that point, you can subsititute L with G for one of the
equations we were given at the beginning. For example, we can turn 1.5L into 1500G, since 1.5 = 0.3x5, and 300*5 = 1500.
Now we know that 1500G + 800G = 69, which means that 2300G = 69. so G = 69/2300 = 3/100. Now that we know what G is, we can solve 
for L. Since 0.3L = 300G, and G = 3/100, 0.3L = 9, and L = 9/0.3 = 90/3 = 30. Now that we've figured out the values of L and
G, you can just plug the values in, to solve the problem. 4.2x30 + 4000x3/100 = 126 + 120 = 246, which is B.



### Problem 3

Problem 3, honestly this one, you can just go with trial and error, start from the five smallest primes, and go from there,
so the smallest 5 primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. If we add all of those then it would be 28, which is obviously not prime, since 
its divisible by 2 right? So we can go to 2,3,5,7,13, which added up becomes 30, at this point you may or may not notice that 
if there is one even number/ the only even prime, 2, and four odd numbers, the result will always be even, since 4 odd numbers 
becomes an even number and adding 2 will not make it odd. So we exclude 2 and keep going. 3,5,7,11,13, the 5 smalles primes 
without 2. Adding them makes it 39, which is not prime, so we keep going. 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, adding them would become 43, which
is prime! Now we only need to add up the digits of 43 with is 7. So the answer is B.


### Problem 4

Right, so Problem 4, this one is fairly simple. What is the biggest two digit number you can have? The answer is 99, so we
    see how many 99s are needed to add to 2024,(it needs to be at least 2024, it can't be less), the answer is 21. Adding the 
    20 99s and the 1 other number will get us exactly 2024, but what we need to find, is simply the least number of two digit number that add to 2024(we don't really need to calculate the extra number), so the answer is 21. So the answer is B.


### Problem 5

So the question asks, what is the the least value of n! so that n! is a multiple of 2024? to answer that question, we can start with finding the prime factorization of 2024, which is 2x2x2x11x23, as you can see, we need 23, and since 23 is a prime, you can only get it if n >= 23. Since it asks for the least value of n, it would be 23. The other parts of the prime factorization would be included as well since 2x2x2 = 8 and both 8 and 11 are in 23!. So the answer is D.


### Problem 6

Problem 6 asks for the number of sucessful swaps you need to chang ABCDEF to FEDCBA. Well first we need to get A to the right most position, that would take 5 swaps. Then you need to get B into the right position, that would take 4 swaps, then C --> 3 swaps, then D --> 2 swaps, then E --> 1 swap. Add all of that together would be 15 swaps so the answer is D.


### Problem 7

So we need the least possible positive sum using 3 numbers, that would require 2 negative numbers that add up to less than the one positive number. We want the negative number to be as big as possible without getting a negative sum. Big negative numbers such as -60, -30, -15, -10 all would result in a negative sum no matter what(you can try it out yourself!). -6 however would work. If for example you try (-6, -1, 10) the sum would be 3, which is the least possbile sum. Therefore the answer is B.
