### Problem 1

Problem 1, it's always pretty simple, so this year it's a question about distance, speed and time. For this problem, the numbers are pretty small, so all you really have to do is just draw it out or model it somehow. So there are 2 cities, A and B and they are 45 miles apart. For Hour 1, Alica is 18 miles from A and Beth is 12 miles from B and they travel a total of 30 miles. There are only 15 miles left. Alicia and Beth just both need to travel for half an hour before they meet. Since Alicia and Beth would then be 27 miles from city A the answer is E. 


### Problem 2

So for problem 2, it's basically a classic word problem with 2 variables. Lets say pizza is P and and orange slices is O. We have the equation: 1/3 P  + 3 1/2 O = 3/4 P  + 1/2 O Simplifiying would make it: 3 O = 5/12 P. But that isn't the end, we need to know how many pounds one pizza weighs. So we know that 1 cup of orange slices is 1/4 pounds. Substuting the orange slices for pounds we get the equation: 3/4 lbs = 5/12 P. To get the pounds for one whole pizza, we multiply both sides by 12/5, which gets us: 9/5 lbs = 1 P. So the answer is 1 4/5s or A.


### Problem 3

Problem 3, so this problem is relatively straightforward. For a perfect square to be divisible by 5, the square root of the perfect square has to be a multiple of 5. So basically we just list them until they get greater than 2023. First there is 5^2, then 10^2 .... until 40^2, since 45^2 = 2025, which is greater than 2023. So there are 8, and the answer is A. 


### Problem 4

This problem seems like you should try the numbers out, but it's actually a lot easier to do if you use one of the basic properties of quadrilaterals, that the sum of the other three sides must be greater than the 4th side. Now this may seem intuitive and slightly obvious, but it helps a lot. So they sum to 26, so the largest side length possible would be slightly less than half of 26, because if it was exactly half or more, it would be impossible for the other 3 sides be greater than the longest side(remember all 4 sides add up to 26). So the greatest possible integer length would be just one less than half of 26 which would be 12. And the answer is D. 


### Problem 5

Problem 5 asks how many digits there are. First we realize that if we just reorder the exponents, they neatly become some power of 10 + some other left over exponents. So first we can change the 8^5 to 2^15 since 2^3 = 8. Next we can change the 15^5 to 5^5 x 3^5. If we multiply the new 5^5 that we got with the 5^10 that is originally there, we get 5^15. So 2^15 x 5^15 x 3^5. We can simplify them into 10^15 x 3^5. So obviously 10^15 has 15 zeros and 1 one. Now we only need to calculate 3^5 and multiply those. 3^5 = 243 and you can just add all 15 zeros at the end. So there are 3+15= 18 digits in total which is answer choice E.


### Problem 6

Problem 6 may seem complicated at first but it's actually really simple. We know the total sum of all vertices, all we need to know is how much each vertex appears in the cube. If you draw a cube you would notice that each vertice connects to exactly 3 edges and each edge connects to exactly 2 faces, and the faces all added together once is the value of the cube. Therefore each vertice appears eactly 2x3 = 6 times. There fore all we need to do is multiply the sum of the verites by 6 to get out answer which is 21x6 = 126. So the answer is D.

### Problem 7

For problem 7, the first step is to list all the ways you can get a running total  of 3 by rolling die. Step 2 is to find out the probability of each scenario and lastly is to add all of them together. So first all the ways you can get 3, there are (1,1,1), (2,1), (1,2), and (3). For (1,1,1) the probability is  1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 which is 1/216. For both (2,1) and (1,2), the probability is 1/6 x 1/6 and since there are 2 the total for those scenaios is 2/36. For (3) the probability is 1/6. So add them all up and you get 49/216 which is B.


### Problem 8

Problem 8 is basically a linear equation problem, you just have to figure out the equation, then solve. So first let's write the equation. 0B = 110F, and 100B = 350F, so, lets assume that F is y and B is x. Then the y intercept would be 110. so it would be y = mx + 110. Then you use the other equation. 350 = 100m + 110 = 100. So then 240/100 = m so then m = 12/5. So the equation is y = 12/5(x) +110, where y is Farenheit and x is Breadus. Now all we need to do is plug in y = 200 to find what value x is when y is 200. So the equation becomes: 200 = 12/5(x) +110. If you simpify you get 90 = 12/5(x). If you multiply both sides by 5/12, you get x = 37.5, so the answer is D.


### Problem 9

Ok Problem 9, so first we start with the constraints. The dates have to be in 2023 and every number must appear an even number of times. This means that 0 and 3 which appears an odd number of times in 2023 must appear at least once in the dates of the month and day. It also means that if we were to introduce a new number, it must appear 2 times, not just once. Lastly another possibility is that 2 can appear another 2 more times. However the important thing here is to remember that they are not just numbers but also dates, which means that you can't have a month greater than 12 and can't have a date greater than 31. So lets list out the possibilites: 20230311, 20230322, 20230131 20230113, 20230223, 20231103 20231130, 20231013, 20231031. There are a total of 9 possibilities, so the answer is E.


### Problem 10

For problem 10 the key is to organize and keep track of the variables. Let's say that the current mean is m and the number of quizzes she took so far is Q. mQ would then be the current total. We now put the question into 2 equations.     (mQ + 11)/Q+1 = m+1 and (mQ + 33)/Q+3 = m+2. If we simpify we get                 mQ+11 = (Q+1)(m+1) which is mQ + 11 = mQ + m + Q +1. The other equation will become mQ +33 = mQ+2Q+3m+6. If we simpify both again we get 10 = m+Q and        27 = 2Q+3m if we manipulate the first equation to 20 = 2m+2Q, we can subtract both to get 7 = m. So the current mean is 7 and the answer is D.


### Problem 11

We know that the area of the squares is 2 and 3, therefore the sidelengths of the squares are sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). We want to know the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg of one of the trianges. Lets say the shorter leg is x. Then we can see, since the 4 triangles are congruent that the longer leg is sqrt(3)-x. We also know that the hypotenuse of the triangle is sqrt(2). With this knowledge, we can form the equation x^2 + (sqrt(3)-x)^2 = 2. Now all we have to do is solve for x. We simplify to: 2x^2 - 2sqrt(3)x + 3. We use the quadratic formula to get x = (sqrt(3) - 1)/2, which would mean the longer leg is (sqrt(3)+1)/2. So the simplified ratio would be 2-sqrt(3), which is C.


### Problem 12

Problem 12 is fairly simple, the first thing is to look at the conditions, especially the second one as it provides the base for the 3 digit numbers that qualify. It states that the number formed by reversing the digits are divisible by 5. That means since it has to be a 3 digit number that the hundreds digit is 5(since the leading digit cannot be 0). The first condition then states that it has to be divisible by 7, which means that all the numbers from 500-600 that are divisible by 7. The first number would be 7x72 = 504. The last would be 7x85 = 595. Therefore there are 14 numbers that satisfy both conditions so the answer is B.


### Problem 13

For Problem 13, drawing a circle reveals that the best Bharat can do is stand where BC and AC form a right angle. In that case, ABC is a 30-60-90 triangle, and we need to find the square of the hypotenuse. We know the length of the side opposite to the 60 degree angle, 48, with which we can figure out the answer. So sqrt(3)x = 48 and we want 2x. so we solve to get the hypotenuse is: 96/sqrt(3). We square that to get 3072, so the answer is C.


### Problem 14

So this problem may seem complicated, but its actually very very simple. The only way a number can have a divisor that is a multiple of 11 is if the number is divisible by 11 itself. Since the limit is 100, there are exactly 9 numbers that meet that requirement: 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99. It also turns out that there is exactly 1/2 chance that you will pick a divisor that is divisible by 11 for all of these numbers(since 11 is prime, it cannot be broken down and each pair of divisors will be a multiple of 11 or 11 and 11 squared is more than 100). Therefore the answer is 9/100 x 1/2 = 9/200 so the answer is B.


### Problem 15

As many of these problems are like, we just need to find a pattern with the first few cases. As we can see from the diagram, the area of the shaded region is: 2^2pi-1^1pi + 4^2pi-3^2pi + 6^2pi -5^2pi ..... So we can get rid of the pi first, to simplify things, and add it back later. So we solve and get: 3+7+11+15.... and get an arithmetic sequence that starts with 3 and increments with 4 each time. 
We have to find out how many of these add up to 2023 and multipy by 2 since each number is 2 squares subtracted with each other. We try the numbers out, and get 64. So the answer is E. 


### Problem 16

Lets say that the games won by the left-handed players is l and the games won by the right handed players is r, and the total number of games played is g. We know that l = 1.4r so l+r = 1.4r+r = 2.4r = g = 12/5. Now we know that the answer is divisible by 2.4 which leaves only B and D. Now we have to see which one is possible. The number of games played can be represented as the number of players-1 + number of players -2 ... +1. Which means that the answer should be able to be represented in that form. We know that 7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 36 and 48 cannot be represented with this from so the answer is 36, which is B.


### Problem 17

So for problem 17 the way I see it is that there is only one possible set of answers for all the sidelengths of the right triangles. We start with the ones in which we know for sure one side(30 or 28), and try out numbers until it fits. In this case we get 30 and 16, 28 and 21, then 9 and 12 (for the triangles w/ hypotenuse on the middle triange). Therefore we get that the lengths of the middle triange are 35, 34 and 15, so the answer is 84, which is A.


### Problem 18


### Problem 19

### Problem 20
 
So for problem 20, we start with the top left square. There are 4! ways to fill that square, since there are 4 color options for the first tile, 3 for the second, 2 for the third and the last is determined by the other 3. Now we move on the the bottom right square. There are exactly 3 ways to choose the bottom left tile in that square, since one tile in it is already filled(the top right tile). Once the bottom left tile is chosen, there is only once option for the remaining tiles. So the answer is 4!x3 = 72. So the answer is D. 

### Problem 21




### Problem 24

Problem 24, the answer to this problem is the area of the large hexagon minus the areas of the 6 smaller hexagons that are in the large hexagon. So we know that they are all regular hexagons which means that all their side lengths are equal and all their angles are equal to 12o degrees. We also know the side length of the smaller hexagons, 1,  and the closest distance between the smallest hexagon and the point of the bigger hexagon, 3/7. So we already know the length of part of the side length of the larger hexagon, which is 1 3/7. We need to find the other part. If you draw some auxilitory lines, we can divide the area between the smaller hexagons and the side length of the bigger one into a parallagram and an isoceles trapzoid. The longer side of the parallagram and the 2 sides of the trapzoid make up the remaining part of the side of the hexagon. So first the longer side of the parallagram, the other longer side is one side of a smaller hexagon, by properties of parallagrams, the 2 opposite sides are the same length, which means that that part is equivalent to 1. The isoceles trapzoid is slightly harder. We know that the larger base has length 1 and that the smaller base has length 3/7. If we draw a few lines and split the trapzoid into 2 30-60-90 triangles and a rectange, we figure out that the leg of the trapzoid is 4/7. So the side of the large hexagon is 3. So the area of the large hexagon-the area of the 6 small hexagons which is (9sqrt(3))/2, which is C.

### Problem 25
